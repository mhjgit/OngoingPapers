    abstract = { Excitation energies of closed-shell systems based on the equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster theory at the singles and doubles (CCSD) level with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) included in the post-Hartree–Fock treatment are implemented in the present work. SOC can be included in both the CC and EOM steps (EOM-SOC-CCSD) or only in the EOM part (SOC-EOM-CCSD). The latter approach is an economical way to account for SOC effects, but excitation energies with this approach are not size-intensive. When the unlinked term in the latter approach is neglected (cSOC-EOM-CCSD), size-intensive excitation energies can be obtained. Time-reversal symmetry and spatial symmetry are exploited to reduce the computational effort. Imposing time-reversal symmetry results in a real matrix representation for the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, which facilitates the requirement of time-reversal symmetry for new trial vectors in Davidson’s algorithm. Results on some closed-shell atoms and molecules containing heavy elements show that EOM-SOC-CCSD can provide excitation energies and spin–orbit splittings with reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, the SOC-EOM-CCSD approach is able to afford accurate estimates of SOC effects for valence electrons of systems containing elements up to the fifth row, while cSOC-EOM-CCSD is less accurate for spin–orbit splittings of transitions involving p1/2 spinors, even for Kr. }

volume="223",
pages="177",
abstract="Numerical simulations present an indispensable way to the understanding of complex physical processes. In quantum mechanics where the theoretical description is given in terms of the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation the road is, however, difficult for any but the simplest systems. This is particularly true if one considers photoionization processes of atoms and molecules which, at the same time, require an accurate description of bound and continuum states and, therefore, an extensive region of space to be sampled during the calculation. As a consequence, direct simulations of photoionization processes are currently only feasible for systems containing up to three electrons. Despite this fundamental restriction, many physical effects can be essentially described by single- and two-electron models, among them are high-order harmonic generation and non-sequential double-ionization of atoms and molecules. A plethora of numerical investigations have been performed on atomic and molecular hydrogen and helium in the last two decades, and these have had a strong impact on the current understanding of photoionization. On the other hand, there are processes which are characterized by the interplay of a larger number of electrons, such as tunnel ionization, the Auger effect and, to give a more recent example, the temporal delay between the photo-emission of electrons from different shells of neon and krypton. The many-electron character of these effects complicates the accurate, time-resolved simulation and, so far, no universally applicable method exists. This review presents two theoretical methods which are promising candidates for closing this gap--the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) method and the time-dependent restricted active space configuration interaction (TD-RASCI) method. Both represent the wavefunction in a linear subspace of the many-body Hilbert space and follow particular strategies to avoid the exponential problem. This makes it possible to treat a much larger number of electrons than with the direct techniques mentioned above.",

    abstract = { The coupled-cluster method is one of the most successful methods for ab initio electronic structure calculations. For computation of expectation values and properties, two equivalent but very different derivations exist: the Lagrangian formulation of Helgaker and Jørgensen [Adv. Quant. Chem. 19, 183 (1988)] and the bivariational formulation of Arponen [Ann. Phys. 151, 311 (1983)]. The latter is, apparently, less well known among quantum chemists, and we therefore discuss and contrast the two approaches. Some generalisations of coupled-cluster based on the bivariational principle are discussed, including the so-called extended coupled-cluster method. }

The confining potential of the electrons in the quantum dot is assumed to be spatially isotropic and harmonic. For up to 40 interacting electrons the ground-state energies and ground-state wavefunctions are calculated at various interaction strengths. The quadrupole moments and electron densities in the quantum dot are computed. Hund's rule is confirmed and a shell structure is identified via the addition energies and the quadrupole moments. While most of the shell structure can be understood on the basis of the unperturbed non-interacting problem, the interplay of an avoided crossing and the Coulomb interaction results in an unexpected closed shell for 19 electrons.",

A complete classification of asymptotic energy levels is performed and the behaviour of energy levels from the quantum to the semiclassical regime is traced. Comparison between the present results and those from exact numerical Hamiltonian diagonalization indicates a fair accuracy of the proposed method over the whole range of the electron-electron coupling constant and magnetic field values. The results obtained indicate that increasing the number of electrons in a dot leads to more classical behaviour of the system.}

abstract = {It is well known that the self-consistent field (SCF) iteration for solving the Kohn–
Sham (KS) equation often fails to converge, yet there is no clear explanation. In this paper, we
investigate the SCF iteration from the perspective of minimizing the corresponding KS total energy
functional. By analyzing the second-order Taylor expansion of the KS total energy functional and
estimating the relationship between the Hamiltonian and the part of the Hessian which is not used
in the SCF iteration, we are able to prove global convergence from an arbitrary initial point and
local linear convergence from an initial point sufficiently close to the solution of the KS equation
under the assumptions that the gap between the occupied states and unoccupied states is sufficiently
large and the second-order derivatives of the exchange correlation functional are uniformly bounded
from above. Although these conditions are very stringent and are almost never satisfied in reality,
our analysis is interesting in the sense that it provides a qualitative prediction of the behavior of the
SCF iteration.}
